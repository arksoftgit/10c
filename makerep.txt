NEW steps to create a Zeidon repository after change to model:

o  Copy changes from model to TE environment.  This involves:

   - Synchronize Tables/Recs from ER.
   - Synchronize Relationships from ER.

   There should no longer be duplicate names in the TE!!!

o  Create DDL from Technical Environment.  Copy it to the repository directory.

o  Replace data file definitions in zmm.ddl with the data file definitions in
   ddl_hdr.txt.  ddl_hdr.txt will need to be updated when any new entities are
   created or if extensive changes have been made to one or more entities.

o  Run Raima DDL processor:

      ddlp ZMM.DDL -d [ -x ]

   '-d' allows different records to have the same field name (necessary for
        zkeys).

   '-x' prints x-ref to the terminal.

   Ignore the warning about record 'zof_rec0'.  This is normal.

o  Initialize database.  This requires the following env vars:

      DBDPATH=directory containing ZMM.DBD (the repository dir)
      DBFPATH=directory containing ZMM.DBD (the repository dir)
      DBTAF  =directory containing Transaction File (usually empty directory).

   Then run:

      initdb ZMM

o  To test that the database OK, run WIDA.  You must have VISTA.DLL in your
   path.

o  Create the catalog file by running "PRDBD zmm > zmm.cat"

o  Back in the TE, select option Utilities/Import DB Data.  This copies the
   record/field id's from the database catalog (zmm.cat) into the TE.
   Save the TE

   ZEIDON.INI (ZMM=...) tells Zeidon where to look for zmm.cat.

o  Save all project LODs.  This saves all the .XOD files with the new TE
   information.

Steps to create a Zeidon repository after change to model:

o  Copy changes from model to TE environment.  This involves:

   - Delete 'ZMM' data source in TE.
   - Create new 'ZMM' (Server=ZRepos, Model=VistaDB, Max attr len=100,
     overflow file len=1000).
   - Synchronize Tables/Recs from ER.
   - Synchronize Relationships from ER.

   It is possible that some records created by m-to-m relationships have the
   same name.  One of them needs to be renamed.  You'll know for sure if two
   records have the same name if the DDLP command (see below) fails.  The
   two names that currently repeat are:

      MM_TE_TABLRECDATAR
      MM_SOURCEFILE_WNDB

   The following sets are duplicated:

      SOURCEFILEOWNEDBYMMSOURCEFILEWN (look under MM_SOURCEFILE_WNDB)
      TETABLRECDATAREISACCESSEDTHRUPO (look under POD_RELLINKMAPREC)

   For each item listed above, one of the duplicates must be renamed.

o  Create DDL from Technical Environment.  Copy it to the repository directory.

o  Replace data file definitions in zmm.ddl with the data file definitions in
   ddl_hdr.txt.  ddl_hdr.txt will need to be updated when any new entities are
   created or if extensive changes have been made to one or more entities.

o  Run Raima DDL processor:

      ddlp ZMM.DDL -d [ -x ]

   '-d' allows different records to have the same field name (necessary for
        zkeys).

   '-x' prints x-ref to the terminal.

   Ignore the warning about record 'zof_rec0'.  This is normal.

o  Initialize database.  This requires the following env vars:

      DBDPATH=directory containing ZMM.DBD (the repository dir)
      DBFPATH=directory containing ZMM.DBD (the repository dir)
      DBTAF  =directory containing Transaction File (usually empty directory).

   Then run:

      initdb ZMM

o  To test that the database OK, run WIDA.  You must have VISTA.DLL in your
   path.

o  Create the catalog file by running "PRDBD zmm > zmm.cat"

o  Back in the TE, select option Synchronize/Physical From Catalog/Init DBRaima
   ID's.  This copies the record/field id's from the database catalog (zmm.cat)
   into the TE.  Save the TE

   ZEIDON.INI (ZMM=...) tells Zeidon where to look for zmm.cat.

o  Save all project LODs.  This saves all the .XOD files with the new TE
   information.


BUGS:

o  Synchronizing with ER allows records to have the same name.  This shouldn't
   happen.

To set up a PC as a repository.

o  Create a Raima database on the server.  To do this, execute the commands
   listed above.

o  All node PC's must have the environment variables DBDPATH, DBFPATH, and
   DBTAF set to point to the directories on the server.  Note that all nodes
   should have the server's repository mapped to the same drive letter (I
   have been using the standard of Z:) as well as the server's TAF (transaction
   file) directory (I use T:).  Each node as well as the server need the
   following in the ZEIDON.INI file in the ZEIDON BIN directory:

      TAF=t:\
      ZMM=z:
      ZMM_BackupPath=z:\back
      ZMM_BackupMethod=Historical
      BaseShadowMETA=z:\SHADOW
      BaseShadowEXEC=z:\SHADOW
      BaseShadowPGM=z:\SHADOW

   T: and Z: point to the server.
