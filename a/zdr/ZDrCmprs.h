/*
     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms may be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     For compression the application must provide the output buffer and
  may optionally provide the input buffer for optimization. For decompression,
  the application must provide the input buffer and may optionally provide
  the output buffer for optimization.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

     The library does not install any signal handler. It is recommended to
  add at least a handler for SIGSEGV when decompressing; the library checks
  the consistency of the input data whenever possible but may go nuts
  for some forms of corrupted input.

   The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first

   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

   zalloc must return 0 if there is not enough memory for the object.
   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in

extern int deflateInit OF((z_stream *strm, int level));

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression. The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.
   If zalloc and zfree are set to 0, deflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at
   all (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).
   Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION requests a default compromise between speed and
   compression (currently equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level,
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (COMPRESS_VERSION).
   msg is set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not
   perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().
*/


extern int deflate OF((z_stream *strm, int flush));
/*
  Performs one or both of the following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).
    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.

  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out
  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
  (avail_out == 0), or after each call of deflate().

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, the current compression
  block is terminated and flushed to the output buffer so that the
  decompressor can get all input data available so far. For method 9, a future
  variant on method 8, the current block will be flushed but not terminated.
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH has the same effect as partial flush except that the compressed
  output is byte aligned (the compressor can clear its internal bit buffer)
  and the current block is always terminated; this can be useful if the
  compressor has to be restarted from scratch after an interruption (in which
  case the internal state of the compressor may be lost).
    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, the compression block is terminated, a
  special marker is output and the compression dictionary is discarded; this
  is useful to allow the decompressor to synchronize if one compressed block
  has been damaged (see inflateSync below).  Flushing degrades compression and
  so should be used only when necessary.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can
  seriously degrade the compression. If deflate returns with avail_out == 0,
  this function must be called again with the same value of the flush
  parameter and more output space (updated avail_out), until the flush is
  complete (deflate returns with non-zero avail_out).

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, all pending input is processed,
  all pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there
  was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be
  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no
  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After
  deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the
  stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression
  is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least
  0.1% larger than avail_in plus 12 bytes.  If deflate does not return
  Z_STREAM_END, then it must be called again as described above.

    deflate() may update data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_ASCII or Z_BINARY). In doubt, the data is considered
  binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect
  the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible.
*/


extern int deflateEnd OF((z_stream *strm));
/*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any
   pending output.

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded). In the error case,
   msg may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be

   allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible

extern int inflate OF((z_stream *strm, int flush));
/*
  Performs one or both of the following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() always provides as much output as possible
    (until there is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate().

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, inflate flushes as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. The flushing behavior of inflate is
  not specified for values of the flush parameter other than Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH
  and Z_FINISH, but the current implementation actually flushes as much output
  as possible anyway.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster routine
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the
  compressed data has been reached and all uncompressed output has been
  produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a preset dictionary is needed at this point (see
  inflateSetDictionary below), Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted,
  Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example if
  next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,
  Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in
  the output buffer when Z_FINISH is used. In the Z_DATA_ERROR case, the
  application may then call inflateSync to look for a good compression block.
  In the Z_NEED_DICT case, strm->adler is set to the Adler32 value of the
  dictionary chosen by the compressor.

                            int  strategy));

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method. It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library. (Method 9 will allow a 64K history buffer and
   partial block flushes.)

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library (the value 16 will be allowed for method 9). Larger
   values of this parameter result in better compression at the expense of
   memory usage. The default value is 15 if deflateInit is used instead.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but
   is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory
   for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory
   usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a
   somewhat random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is
   tuned to compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more
   Huffman coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate
   between Z_DEFAULT and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. The strategy parameter only affects
   the compression ratio but not the correctness of the compressed output even
   if it is not set appropriately.

     If next_in is not null, the library will use this buffer to hold also
   some history information; the buffer must either hold the entire input
   data, or have at least 1<<(windowBits+1) bytes and be writable. If next_in
   is null, the library will allocate its own history buffer (and leave next_in
   null). next_out need not be provided here but must be provided by the
   application for the next call of deflate().

     If the history buffer is provided by the application, next_in must
   must never be changed by the application since the compressor maintains
   information inside this buffer from call to call; the application
   must provide more input only by increasing avail_in. next_in is always
   reset by the library in this case.

      deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was
   not enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as
   an invalid method). msg is set to null if there is no error message.
   deflateInit2 does not perform any compression: this will be done by
   deflate().

/*
     Initializes the compression dictionary (history buffer) from the given
   byte sequence without producing any compressed output. This function must
   be called immediately after deflateInit or deflateInit2, before any call
   of deflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary).
     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and
   can be predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better
   than with the default empty dictionary. In this version of the library,
   only the last 32K bytes of the dictionary are used.
     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the Adler32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The Adler32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.)

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state
   is inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this

   application to provide the correct values of next_out and avail_out for the
   next call of deflate.

     This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
   tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
   data with a filter. The streams that will be discarded should then be freed
   by calling deflateEnd.  Note that deflateCopy duplicates the internal
   compression state which can be quite large, so this strategy is slow and
   can consume lots of memory.

     deflateCopy returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as zalloc being NULL). msg is left unchanged in both source and
   destination.

     This function is equivalent to deflateEnd followed by deflateInit,

   available so far is compressed with the old level (and may be flushed);

extern int inflateInit2 OF((z_stream *strm,

     This is another version of inflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_out, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library (the value 16 will be allowed soon). The
   default value is 15 if inflateInit is used instead. If a compressed stream
   with a larger window size is given as input, inflate() will return with
   the error code Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     If next_out is not null, the library will use this buffer for the history
   buffer; the buffer must either be large enough to hold the entire output
   data, or have at least 1<<windowBits bytes.  If next_out is null, the
   library will allocate its own buffer (and leave next_out null). next_in
   need not be provided here but must be provided by the application for the
   next call of inflate().

     If the history buffer is provided by the application, next_out must
   never be changed by the application since the decompressor maintains
   history information inside this buffer from call to call; the application
   can only reset next_out to the beginning of the history buffer when
   avail_out is zero and all output has been consumed.

      inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was
   not enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as
   windowBits < 8). msg is set to null if there is no error message.
   inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression: this will be done by

   call of inflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see deflateSetDictionary).

     inflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state is

  case, the application may save the current current value of total_in which
