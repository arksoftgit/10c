1. Alter the date in the zeidon.lyt file.
2. Run disklay.bat (zeidon.lyt is processed to produce zeidon.inf) to
   create c:\test and c:\comp directories.  Note that zeidon.lyt points
   to the zeidon directories.  If the zeidon directories are changed,
   zeidon.lyt must be changed to reflect the directory change.
3. Copy the [Source Media Descriptions] entries from copy.inf to
   zeidon.inf (the ones in copy.inf are complete ... the ones in
   zeidon.inf are incomplete and incorrect.
4. Run chginf.bat to create the zeidon?.bat files which are used to
   copy the compressed zeidon files to their respective diskettes.
